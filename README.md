* 1 teaspoon of sugar
* 1 teaspoon of dried oregano
* 2 chorizo sausages
* Salt and black pepper to taste
* Extra virgin olive oil



1. Cook the macaroni in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente, according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.


2. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat some oil and cook the chorizo sausages until browned and crisp, turning occasionally. Transfer to a plate and keep warm.
